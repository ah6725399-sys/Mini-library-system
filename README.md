# Mini-library-system
Build a Library Data Manager that: 1. Stores book information (ID, Title, Author) using a dynamic array. 2. Allows searching for a book ID using linear search. 3. Maintains a stack of recently deleted book IDs to allow an Undo Delete option. 4. Uses a 2D array to display all book records in a tabular format.
